            </div>
            <p>Hello everyone! I have observed some suspicous behavior by what I suspect are non-resident of the sub and I have read what people have put online about their issues. So I wanted to let everyone know how they can protect themselves from criminals. As background, I served ten years in the Marine Corps in various forms of law enforcement and I currently work for the State Police where I advise infrastructure owners on how to make their facilites and assets more secure. Here are some physical security measures that will make our neighborhood more safe!

            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>1. Upgrade Your Door and Window Locks</strong>
          </p>
          <p>

            One of the most critical improvements you can make for residential security is to upgrade your door and window locks. Consider installing deadbolt locks with longer bolts, as they offer superior resistance against forced entry. Reinforce your doors and frames with strike plates and door jammers to provide added strength and durability. For windows, install window locks or consider using laminated or reinforced glass to make them more resistant to break-ins.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>2. Install Security Cameras and Alarms</strong>
          </p>
          <p>

            Installing security cameras and alarms is an effective deterrent against potential intruders. Place security cameras at strategic locations around your property, such as entry points and areas with limited visibility. Opt for cameras with high-resolution video capabilities and night vision to capture clear footage in various lighting conditions. Pair the cameras with a robust alarm system that includes sensors on doors and windows. This combination provides both surveillance and immediate alerts to any unauthorized access.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>3. Enhance Outdoor Lighting</strong>
          </p>
          <p>

            Proper outdoor lighting is an often overlooked aspect of residential security. Well-lit exteriors can deter criminals and improve overall visibility. Install motion-sensor lights around the perimeter of your property, particularly near entry points, pathways, and dark corners. These lights automatically turn on when they detect motion, providing illumination and alerting homeowners to any potential intrusions.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>4. Strengthen Perimeter Security</strong>
          </p>
          <p>

            Take measures to strengthen the security of your property's perimeter. Install a sturdy fence around your yard, ensuring it is tall enough to discourage easy access. Consider using materials that limit visibility from the outside, preventing potential burglars from scoping out your property. Additionally, install secure gates with locks that are difficult to bypass.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>5. Secure Your Garage</strong>
          </p>
          <p>

            Don't overlook the security of your garage, as it can provide an entry point for burglars. Keep the garage doors locked at all times, and consider reinforcing them with additional locks or installing a security system specifically designed for garages. If your garage has windows, cover them or use frosted glass to prevent outsiders from seeing inside.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>6. Practice Secure Key Management</strong>
          </p>
          <p>

            Proper key management is essential for residential security. Avoid hiding spare keys in obvious places outside your home, such as under doormats or flower pots, as these are the first places burglars will check. Instead, consider using a secure key lockbox or entrust a spare key to a trusted neighbor or family member. Regularly rekey or change the locks if you misplace a key or suspect it may have fallen into the wrong hands.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>8. Be Mindful of Social Media</strong>
          </p>
          <p>

            Avoid oversharing information about your home and your whereabouts on social media platforms. Posting vacation plans or photos while away from home can alert potential burglars that your property is unoccupied. Exercise caution when accepting friend requests or sharing personal details with unknown individuals online.

                We all need to work together to keep our neighborhood beautiful, safe, and KEEP OUR PROPERTY VALUES RISING! If you see something say something. That includes sidewalk issues, landscaping, suspicious people, and any other concerns that may impact the community. Volunteering and reporting concerns are essential steps in maintaining a vibrant and secure neighborhood. Let's explore the significance of community involvement, the benefits of volunteering, and how reporting concerns can contribute to a better living environment.
              </p>
              <p>

                <strong>1. The Power of Community Involvement</strong>
              </p>
              <p>

                Community involvement plays a vital role in creating a strong and connected neighborhood. When residents actively participate and engage in their community, it fosters a sense of belonging, unity, and pride. By working together, neighbors can address common concerns and make a positive impact on the overall well-being of the neighborhood.
              </p>
              <p>

                <strong>2. The Benefits of Volunteering</strong>
              </p>
              <p>

                Volunteering is a fantastic way to give back to your community and make a difference. Here are some key benefits of volunteering:

                - Building Relationships: Volunteering allows you to connect with fellow community members, fostering friendships and building a supportive network.
                - Skill Development: Volunteering provides opportunities to develop new skills or enhance existing ones. Whether it's organizing events, landscaping, or coordinating neighborhood watch programs, volunteering can broaden your skill set and increase your knowledge.
                - Sense of Purpose: Contributing to the betterment of your community gives you a sense of purpose and fulfillment. It allows you to play an active role in shaping the environment in which you live.
                - Strengthening the Community: Volunteering strengthens the fabric of your neighborhood by creating a collective effort towards common goals. It encourages cooperation and unity among residents.
              </p>
              <p>

                <strong>3. Reporting Concerns for a Safer Community</strong>
              </p>
              <p>

                Reporting concerns is a crucial step in maintaining a safe and secure neighborhood. When community members promptly report suspicious activities, maintenance issues, or other concerns, it allows appropriate action to be taken. Here's why reporting concerns is important:

                - Crime Prevention: Reporting suspicious activities to the local authorities helps keep your community safe. Timely reporting can lead to the identification and prevention of criminal behavior.
                - Maintaining Property Values: Addressing concerns such as broken sidewalks, unkempt landscaping, or abandoned properties can help maintain property values. By reporting these issues to the relevant authorities or homeowner associations, steps can be taken to rectify them.
                - Creating a Welcoming Environment: Reporting concerns contributes to creating a welcoming and attractive environment for residents and visitors alike. It ensures that the neighborhood remains a desirable place to live and promotes a positive image.
                - Building Trust: Reporting concerns builds trust among community members. When residents know they can rely on each other to address issues, it fosters a sense of security and unity within the neighborhood.
              </p>
              <p>

                <strong>4. How to Report Concerns</strong>
              </p>
              <p>

                Reporting concerns can be done through various channels, depending on the nature of the issue:

                - Local Law Enforcement: For suspicious activities or potential criminal behavior, contact your local police department or emergency services. Provide as much information as possible, including descriptions of individuals or vehicles involved.
                - Homeowner Associations: You can report directly to Condominium Management Company by calling 248 353 9010 or on Facebook by messaging Shelly Kenward

            <div class="head"><span class="headline hl5">REPOST: An Interview About Ponds</span><p><span class="headline hl4">by MATT HELMKAMP</span></p></div>
            <p>Dr. Lori Wolfson, a professor at the Institute of Water Research, doesn't mince words and doesn't hesitate to unload an absurd amount of pond knowledge. You think you know a thing or two about ponds, until you don't.</p>
            <figure class="figure">

              <figcaption class="figcaption">A less smelly pond</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p><i>"It sounds like EGLE actually went out to your pond to assess the situation and came up with their analysis.  If the smell is actually from sulfur, actually hydrogen sulfide gas, then it would have that rotten egg type of smell.  Methane, by itself, is odorless, but it often mixes with hydrogen sulfide.  When plants and animal die and begin decomposing, the organic matter in the bottom sediments build up.  If oxygen is lacking, then these gases can form.  So, it is possible that the analysis is correct, and the smell is coming from these gasses.  Duckweed, by itself, wouldn’t put out an odor unless it were dying.  That’s probably the case."</i> Dr. Wolfson responded.</p>

            <p>The solution? It's precisily what we all thought: the incredibly expensive dredging operation.</p>

            <p>While the board puts together dredging proposals, Dr. Wolfson had one last recommendation for those living on the water's edge. <i>"Unfortunately, there’s no magic bullet that can fix the problem right now.  In the future, decreasing nutrient input in the lake, and perhaps planting some native vegetation to compete with the duckweed (perhaps Chara, a low growing macroalgae) may help keep the problem from occurring again."</i></p>

              <h2>Decks, pools, etc</h2>
               If you plan on building a deck, pool or any other structure governed by our bylaws, call the management company for the procedures necessary to get approval from the architectural committee.  If you aren’t sure your project needs to be approved, they can help you with the guidelines.

               <h2>PUP!</h2>
               Puppies are sooo cute.  Even big puppies are cute.  In this case “PUP” is an acronym for PICK UP THE POOP
