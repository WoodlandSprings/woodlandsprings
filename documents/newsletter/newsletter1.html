            <p>In an uncertain economy, the preservation of value becomes paramount.  For most of us, the biggest personal investment we may ever make is our homes.  As an association, we have the power to preserve and increase the value of this investment.  It does, however, take the efforts of all association members to achieve these goals.  In most cases the effort requires nothing more than complying with the bylaws, paying dues and being a good neighbor.  Some choose to do more by taking an active role in the community.  In either instance the effort is minimal, yet essential.</p>

            <p>Dr. Lori Wolfson, a professor at the Institute of Water Research, doesn't mince words and doesn't hesitate to unload an absurd amount of pond knowledge. You think you know a thing or two about ponds, until you don't.</p>

            </figure>
            <p><i>"It sounds like EGLE actually went out to your pond to assess the situation and came up with their analysis.  If the smell is actually from sulfur, actually hydrogen sulfide gas, then it would have that rotten egg type of smell.  Methane, by itself, is odorless, but it often mixes with hydrogen sulfide.  When plants and animal die and begin decomposing, the organic matter in the bottom sediments build up.  If oxygen is lacking, then these gases can form.  So, it is possible that the analysis is correct, and the smell is coming from these gasses.  Duckweed, by itself, wouldn’t put out an odor unless it were dying.  That’s probably the case."</i> Dr. Wolfson responded.</p>

            <p>The solution? It's precisily what we all thought: the incredibly expensive dredging operation.</p>

            <p>While the board puts together dredging proposals, Dr. Wolfson had one last recommendation for those living on the water's edge. <i>"Unfortunately, there’s no magic bullet that can fix the problem right now.  In the future, decreasing nutrient input in the lake, and perhaps planting some native vegetation to compete with the duckweed (perhaps Chara, a low growing macroalgae) may help keep the problem from occurring again."</i></p>

                Michael Martz revived the beautification committee a couple of years ago to help offset the high cost of landscaping.  Although his neighborhood survey showed that 36 neighbors would consider helping on beautification projects, he ended up with two.  Jessica Kokalis and Cindy Veresh.

              <p>
                There are a lot of projects that need to be done and if we don’t have the volunteers to do them we can just hire it out.  If you care to volunteer get ahold of Michael.  He is on our FB page.

               If you plan on building a deck, pool or any other structure governed by our bylaws, call the management company for the procedures necessary to get approval from the architectural committee.  If you aren’t sure your project needs to be approved, they can help you with the guidelines.

               Puppies are sooo cute.  Even big puppies are cute.  In this case “PUP” is an acronym for PICK UP THE POOP
