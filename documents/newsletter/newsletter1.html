            <p>Dr. Lori Wolfson, a professor at the Institute of Water Research, doesn't mince words and doesn't hesitate to unload an absurd amount of pond knowledge. You think you know a thing or two about ponds, until you don't.</p>

            </figure>
            <p><i>"It sounds like EGLE actually went out to your pond to assess the situation and came up with their analysis.  If the smell is actually from sulfur, actually hydrogen sulfide gas, then it would have that rotten egg type of smell.  Methane, by itself, is odorless, but it often mixes with hydrogen sulfide.  When plants and animal die and begin decomposing, the organic matter in the bottom sediments build up.  If oxygen is lacking, then these gases can form.  So, it is possible that the analysis is correct, and the smell is coming from these gasses.  Duckweed, by itself, wouldn’t put out an odor unless it were dying.  That’s probably the case."</i> Dr. Wolfson responded.</p>

            <p>The solution? It's precisily what we all thought: the incredibly expensive dredging operation.</p>

            <p>While the board puts together dredging proposals, Dr. Wolfson had one last recomendation for those living on the water's edge. <i>"Unfortunately, there’s no magic bullet that can fix the problem right now.  In the future, decreasing nutrient input in the lake, and perhaps planting some native vegetation to compete with the duckweed (perhaps Chara, a low growing macroalgae) may help keep the problem from occurring again."</i></p>
